### Purpose
Make vite work as a bundler for backend frameworks which doesn't have their own official/unofficial vite plugins

I am gradually experimenting with it in my free time with PHP, Python and .net frameworks. Its made in such a way that it should work with most minimal changes. 

### Docs
Havent't started with docs yet because I am focusing on the features first as its still in experimental phase
